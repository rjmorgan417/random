        <!-- Basic information. Not required for the assignment, but added to provide context. -->
        <p>I learned to fish as a young kid, but as I grew into my teen years and beyond, I lost interest in doing it as much. Years went by, and the years became decades - decades 
          without fishing. After I returned from Afghanistan, the family and I moved to Fort Rucker, Alabama; it's a great, outdoorsy place. It's also just north of Florida, where my
          oldest sister and brother-in-law live. They have a spare room and invited us to use it, so we started visiting them as often as work allowed.</p>
          <p>At the onset of our trips there, my brother-in-law started taking me kayak fishing in the Florida sound. It was then that I began to kick myself for all of the decades that 
          I had neglected to take part in such a great pass-time. I was hooked. My family surprised me with a modest beginner set of tackle, I purchased a kayak from a friend, and then I started spending 
          my spare time out on a local pond.</p>
          <p>After Fort Rucker, my family and I moved to Fort Irwin, California. It's a beautiful post... for a desert. One thing about deserts... they don't have a lot of lakes. So, 
          my new found love faded from thought for another three years.</p>
          <p>Then came my first full summer of retirement. I went through some growing pains, but I finally started to get the hang of fishing again. I eventually found my groove, and 
          started regularly pulling smallmouth bass out of the James River around Nixa and Galena. Toward the end of the summer, I went on my first trout excursion at Montauk State 
          Park and caught the limit.</p>
          <p>Here's to many more happy years of fishing!</p>
